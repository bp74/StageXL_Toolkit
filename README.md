##Toolkit for Dart

<http://toolkitfordart.github.io/>

The Toolkit for Dart is an extension to Flash Professional CC to publish artwork and 
animation to the Dart language, which is a class-based, object-oriented language and 
compiles to efficient JavaScript that is being developed as open source by Google. 
The extension creates a fully functional and cleanly organized Dart project, 
leveraging the StageXL for Dart library to reproduce Flash runtime features.

Toolkit for Dart supports many of the core animation and drawing capabilities of 
Flash Pro, including bitmaps, shapes, movie clips, graphic symbols, classic tweens 
and motion guides, simple buttons, text fields, drop-shadow and glow filters, 
additive blend mode, single-shape masks, visible and cacheAsBitmap display options, 
and embedded audio.
